# Sarcasm Classification Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at building a sarcasm classification model using natural language processing techniques and machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines to predict whether a given sentence is sarcastic or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NLTK
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy


## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sarcasm-classification.git
```


## Usage

1. Open the notebook, you can find two separate code. One's for the customized training and the other to train using ready corpus data.
-Open the Jupyter Notebook (sarcasm_classification.ipynb) in your local environment.
-Execute the cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
-Use the trained model for sarcasm prediction.

## Preprocessing
Text data is preprocessed by cleaning, tokenizing, and removing stop words. The cleaned data is then used for training.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a validation set, and accuracy and loss curves are plotted.
